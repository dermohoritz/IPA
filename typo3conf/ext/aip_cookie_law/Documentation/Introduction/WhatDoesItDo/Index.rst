Cookie Law Management allows to manage cookies accordingly to European Laws.
It allows a TYPO3 integrator to configure the web site in order to prevent cookies to be installed respecting  web site user choice using a combination of JQuery and Typoscript.
The extension works at the rendering level so that it can disable cookie installation caused either by standard content elements or third party TYPO3 extensions.
It is shipped with the capability to manage out of the box many 3rd party cookies (Google Analytics, Youtube, Vimeo, Slideshare and others) but it can be easily extended using regular expressions to manage any kind of  cookie.

The cookies that are currently handled by Cookie Law Management are those generated by: Facebook, Flickr, GoogleMaps, Prezi, SlideShare, Twitter, Vimeo, YouTube.

When a visitor enters the website for the first time, it will check the following and take action upon: it searches for its own meta cookies for indication of visitor previous choices, if they are not present or the user has explicitly denied the usage of specific cookies, the extension will prevent the loading of scripts or iframes. The web site visitor can re-enable these elements using a tab showed on the web page that will execute some javascript to re-include them into the DOM.
